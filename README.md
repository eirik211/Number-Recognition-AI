# Number-Recognition-AI
A neural net gets trained to identify handwritten numbers.


## Requirements
In order to execute this program, you will have to install the following: numpy, matplotlib

# How does it work?
## Neural Network
The neural network consists of 3 layers:
+ input-layer: 784 neurons  --> pixels of the 28\*28 image
+ hidden-layer: 24 neurons  
+ output-layer: 10 neurons  --> matching with the numbers (0 - 9)
